# Advent of Code 2020 starter for JS

## Intro

This repo contains zero-setup environment for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges created by [caderek](https://github.com/caderek) (thanks!), with:

- automatic creation of a challenge template,
- automatic execution of a challenge code (with reloads),
- quick utils for testing and reading input from a file.

## Running dev mode

```
npm start day<N>
```

or

```
yarn start day<N>
```

Example:

```
yarn start day1
```

If the day folder does not exist, it will be created from template.
